I recently got this fleeting idea that I should probably start keeping a repository of all the little random tidbits of technical knowledge that I learn on a daily - mostly through reading blogs and doing stuff at work - as a way of remembering these things for future use/reference. The contents would range from code snippets, bash commands that I always seem to forget, definitions (_glossary of terms_), ideas, concepts, really just anything I thought useful at the time. But like I said, the idea was fleeting so I quickly forgot about it.

Today though, while reading an [article on another personal blog](https://www.wezm.net/technical/2019/02/alpine-linux-docker-infrastructure/) that I found through hacker news, I stumbled upon an implementation of something similar to what I'd been contemplating, **only better** - in that it was real, was neatly organised, had a nice summary about why it existed, and brought to my attention what this sort of thing is called. A **personal knowledge base**. You can read all about PKBs here [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_base).

Anyways, the personal knowledge base I saw, liked, and decided to shamelessly steal is this one: [https://linkedlist.org/](https://linkedlist.org/) by [Wesley Moore](http://www.wezm.net/)

Something that he mentioned in his summary of "Why this was created" that I really liked was this:

> The idea is that each page doesn’t have to be a fully fledged tutorial or blog post. - Wesley Moore

This resonates with me because not every piece of information I come across warrants a fully fledged article. Most times a one liner, in and of itself, is enough. That's especially true for serial procrastinators who have a habit of keeping blog drafts unpublished for months on end. The idea of jotting something down really quickly and moving on is quite appealing to me.
